But I\â€™m so glad I did. My fantastic customers kept me going, kept me busy and to be honest, they kept me alive. I really appreciate each and everyone of you. Thank you. I will be closed for vacation this year in early May for a week and in late August for a week.Letâ€™s keep these honeybees busy!',
